# MDM

Zentral can be used as MDM server for Apple devices.

## Zentral configuration

To activate the MDM module, you need to add a `zentral.contrib.mdm` section to the `apps` section in `base.json`.

### SCEP CA issuer chain

To authenticate the OTA enrollments, Zentral needs the SCEP CA issuer certificate chain in PEM form in the `scep_ca_fullchain` key of the `zentral.contrib.mdm` section. It is possible to use the `{{ file:PATH_TO_PEM_CHAIN }}` substitution to load the chain from a file on disk.

### mTLS proxy

Zentral is expecting the client certificate in PEM form in the `X-SSL-Client-Cert` header, and the client certificate subject DN in the `X-SSL-Client-S-DN` header. If this is not possible, you can set `mtls_proxy` to `false` in the `zentral.contrib.mdm` section. In that case, the Apple devices will be configured to add a header containing the payload signature in each HTTP request. See the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/implementing_device_management/managing_certificates_for_mdm_servers_and_devices#3677960). This adds approximately 2KB of data to each message.

## Variable substitution

It is possible to use variable substitution to customize [configuration profiles](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/configuring_multiple_devices_using_profiles) and application configurations (see [InstallApplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/installapplicationcommand/command/configuration) and [InstallEnterpriseApplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/installenterpriseapplicationcommand/command/configuration) MDM commands) with device or user attributes. The following variables are available:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`$ENROLLED_DEVICE.UDID`|UDID of the enrolled device|
|`$ENROLLED_DEVICE.SERIAL_NUMBER`|Serial number of the enrolled device|
|`$ENROLLED_USER.LONG_NAME`|Long name of the user reported by the MDM|
|`$ENROLLED_USER.SHORT_NAME`|Short name of the user reported by the MDM|
|`$REALM_USER.USERNAME`|Username of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.DEVICE_USERNAME`|Device username (first part of the username split on `@`, with `.` removed) of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.EMAIL_PREFIX`|first part of the email split on `@` of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.EMAIL`|email of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.FIRST_NAME`|first name of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.LAST_NAME`|last name of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.FULL_NAME`|full name of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.CUSTOM_ATTR_1`|first custom attribute of the realm user|
|`$REALM_USER.CUSTOM_ATTR_2`|second custom attribute of the realm user|

NB: the realm user variables are only available when a realm authentication is configured in the enrollment.

## Push certificates

To be able to send notifications to the devices, Zentral requires a push certificate (also known as an APNS certificate). You have two options to obtain this:

* Use our signed Certificate Signing Request (CSR): Since Zentral is an approved vendor, you can directly use our provided signed CSR in Zentral Cloud (SaaS) instances.

* Generate your own MDM vendor certificate: An Apple [Developer Enterprise Account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/) with the ability to generate MDM CSRs is required. You can then use this vendor certificate to sign an APNS certificate request. The `mdmcerts` Zentral management command can be used to help with this process.


### Configure Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)

To configure the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for Zentral Cloud, follow these steps. 

* Navigate to the Zentral *MDM > Overview > Push certificates* section.
* Open the `Zentral Cloud` certificate detail page.
* Click on the button to download a signed CSR `push_certificate_signed_csr.b64` file.
* Sign in to the [Apple Push Certificate Portal](https://identity.apple.com).
* Upload the `push_certificate_signed_csr.b64` signed certificate request file.
* Download the generated APNs certificate.
* Return to the Zentral *MDM > Overview > Push certificates > Zentral Cloud* certificate detail page. 
* Upload the generated APNs certificate.

This configuration is now ready for Zentral MDM push capabilities. To renew an existing push certificate, repeat those steps. 

**IMPORTANT** do not let the push/APNS certificates expire! Remember to renew them ahead of their expiry!

To be able to keep sending notifications to enrolled devices, it is important to renew the existing certificates, and not generate new ones (it is important that the *topic* of a push certificate stays the same). In the [Apple Push Certificate Portal](https://identity.apple.com), look for the existing certificate and click on the `Renew` button, and not on the `Create a Certificate` button.

### MDM vendor certificate (Developer Enterprise Account required)
To generate your own MDM vendor certificate, run the following command to setup a working directory with a vendor certificate request:

```bash
python server/manage.py mdmcerts -d the_working_directory init
```

* Choose a password for the vendor certificate request private key, and remember it!

The content of the working directory should be the following:
```bash
$ ls the_working_directory
vendor.csr  vendor.key
```

 * Sign in to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account) and navigate to [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list).
 * Create a new certificate, choose *Services > MDM CSR*.
 * Upload the `vendor.csr` file.
 * Download the generated certificate and store it as `vendor.crt` in the working directory.

### Push/APNS certificate

Run the following command to create an APNS certificate request and sign it with the vendor certificate:

```bash
python server/manage.py mdmcerts -d the_working_directory req COUNTRYCODE
```

 * Choose a password for the push/APNS certificate request private key, and remember it!
 * Enter the password for the MDM vendor certificate private key.

The content of the working directory should be the following:
```bash
$ ls the_working_directory
push.b64  push.csr  push.key  vendor.crt  vendor.csr  vendor.key
```

 * Sign in to the [Apple Push Certificate Portal](https://identity.apple.com).
 * To renew an existing certificate, choose the certificate and click the *Renew* button.
 * To create a new certificate, click the *Create a Certificate* button.
 * Upload the `push.b64` signed certificate request.
 * Download the generated certificate.

Navigate to the Zentral *MDM > Push certificates* section, and either select an existing certificate and click on the *Update* button to renew an existing certificate, or click on the *Add* button to create a new push certificate. Upload the generated certificate, the `push.key` private key, and enter the password of the push certificate private key.

### Renewing a Push/APNS certificate

**IMPORTANT** do not let the push/APNS certificates expire! Remember to renew them ahead of their expiry!

To be able to keep sending notifications to enrolled devices, it is important to renew the existing certificates, and not generate new ones (it is important that the *topic* of a push certificate stays the same). In the [Apple Push Certificate Portal](https://identity.apple.com), look for the existing certificate and click on the `Renew` button, and not on the `Create a Certificate` button. In the Zentral *MDM > Push certificates* section, find the certificate and click on the *Update* button, and do not *Add* a new certificate.
